# Hypermatrix-findpathway

## Overview

`Hypermatrix-findpathway` is a tool designed to identify pathways and networks from multi-omics data using tensor decomposition techniques. The project leverages advanced matrix and tensor operations to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in complex biological datasets.

## Features

- **Tensor Decomposition**: Implements various tensor decomposition methods to analyze high-dimensional data.
- **Pathway Identification**: Identifies potential biological pathways and networks from processed omics data.
- **Multi-omics Integration**: Capable of integrating multiple types of omics data, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Users can customize parameters for their specific datasets and research questions.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, clone the repository and use the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidWarrenKatz/Hypermatrix-findpathway.git
cd Hypermatrix-findpathway
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

Ensure your input data is preprocessed and formatted according to the guidelines specified in the `docs/` directory. The input should be multi-dimensional matrices (tensors) corresponding to the different omics layers.

### Running the Analysis

The main analysis can be run using the `findpathway.py` script. Here is an example command:

```bash
python findpathway.py --input your_data_file --output results_directory --params params.json
```

For more detailed usage and a list of all available parameters, refer to the `docs/usage.md` file.

### Example

An example dataset and a step-by-step walkthrough are provided in the `examples/` directory. This will guide you through the process of setting up your analysis.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for the repository is available in the `docs/` directory, including:

- **Getting Started**: Overview of the project and installation instructions.
- **Usage Guide**: Detailed instructions on how to use the tool, including parameter settings and output interpretation.
- **API Reference**: Description of the core functions and modules.
